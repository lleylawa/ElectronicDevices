# Electronic Devices

## Project Description

This project is a JavaFX-based GUI application for managing various types of electronic devices, including smartphones, laptops, and tablets. Users can add devices with specific attributes, view them in a list, and remove selected devices. The project demonstrates object-oriented principles, including inheritance and encapsulation, by modeling each device type as a separate subclass. This project is ideal for anyone looking to understand JavaFX GUIs and implement class hierarchies in Java.

## Features

- **Device Management**: Add, display, and remove devices from a list.
- **Device Types**: Includes specific fields and attributes for:
  - **Smartphones**: Screen size and camera resolution.
  - **Laptops**: RAM size and processor type.
  - **Tablets**: Battery life and stylus support.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed with JavaFX’s TabPane for easy device type selection and intuitive user input fields.
